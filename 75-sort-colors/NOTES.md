* Sort with o(nlogn)
* Count occurance of 0,1,2 with o(2n) - it will take two pass but in case if it needs to done in one pass o(N) then see
* **Dutch flag algo ** :* psudo code:*;
lo=0,hi=len(a)-1,mid=0
while mid >= high:
see code
so technically everything left to lo will be 0s and low to mid-1 will be 1 and high to length will be 2s, cuz mid is moving only on 1\
â€‹
**Intuition**
make and try to remember algo as you want everything as 0 on left of low so dont make it move on 1 or 2 and everthing till mid be 1 so move it on 1
